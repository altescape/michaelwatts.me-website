Although I have been involved in website and app development for quite some time, I have recently gained a deeper appreciation for addressing the difficulties faced by people with disabilities. While I had previously encountered and adhered to general accessibility standards and guidelines, I now understand the importance of prioritizing accessibility for people with disabilities.

> At least 1 in 5 people in the UK have a long term illness, impairment or disability. Many more have a temporary disability.

> &mdash; <cite>gov.uk website - Understanding accessibility</cite>

There are [16 million people in the UK](https://www.scope.org.uk/media/disability-facts-figures/) who have a long term disability, many more with a temporary disability. Any one of us, at any given time, could encounter an injury resulting in some form of disability, whether it's related to mobility, hearing, vision, or any other potential impairment.

## Navigating web pages with a screen reader

Testing pages with a screen reader is relatively easy if you're on windows you can grab a free copy of NVDA.
NVDA documentation provides a list of shortcuts to navigate a website ([see here for a full list](https://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/nvda)).

### Navigating pages

If you have not used a screen reader to navigate a web page, the amount of information fed back to you can be overwhelming. It can be a bit like visiting one of those busy old websites from the 90s, with flashing gifs, tickers, rainbows, etc. There is too much noise.

One thing I've learned is the need for manually testing components with a screen reader during development. In the context of delivering information concisely to the user, the main objective is to provide an experience that is both minimalistic and tranquil so that the user does not feel overwhelmed, does not waste time and gets the information they are looking for. It's worth noting that automated methods such as UI or unit testing were less effective in attaining this goal. I'm not yet aware of any automated testing software that help in this regard.

### Building a web component that provides concise information

Below is an example of a very simple web component that provides too much information (for what it is conveying) and another example with improvements.

#### Typical HTML for a list item with a link

The below HTML represents a navigation list item with a link and an image. The link is wrapped around the image and the image has an alt tag. The link is also wrapped around a heading tag and a time tag.

<li class="list-none w-80 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden mb-5 shadow-2xl border">
  <a href="https://example.com">
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/27/300/120"
      alt="A man stands on the edge of a cliff looking out to a rough sea."
      class="w-full"
    />
  </a>
  <div class="flex justify-between items-baseline px-3 py-3">
    <h2 class="m-0 leading-none">
      <a href="https://example.com">Example Link</a>
    </h2>
    <time class="text-sm">Jan 02, 2023</time>
  </div>
</li>


```html
<li>
  <a href="https://example.com">
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/27/300/120"
      alt="A man stands on the edge of a cliff looking out to a rough sea."
    />
  </a>
  <div>
    <h2>
      <a href="https://example.com">Example Link</a>
    </h2>
    <time>Jan 02, 2023</time>
  </div>
</li>
```

##### Screen reader output

This is what NVDA will read out aloud from the above HTML:

<ul class="list-none bg-stipes-fuchsia rounded-lg font-mono m-0 p-3">
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-fuchsia-500 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none">ðŸ’¬ link image to https://example.com</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-fuchsia-500 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none">ðŸ’¬ Image alt: "A description about this image"</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-fuchsia-500 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none">ðŸ’¬ Heading tag H6 0. Link "Example Link" to "https://example.com"</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-fuchsia-500 rounded-lg list-none">ðŸ’¬ Jan 02, 2023</li>
</ul>

This is part of a list so it is worth considering that if there are many more items it could potentially overwhelm users relying on screen readers.

Changing the previous block to the following and using a neat little trick I nicked from the BBC you can cut down the chatter to a single line:

#### Component after improvement:

<li class="flex flex-col list-none w-80 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden mb-5 shadow-2xl border relative">
  <p class="order-2 flex justify-between items-baseline p-3 m-0">
    <a href="https://example.com" class="text-xl font-bold after::content-[''] after:absolute after:top-0 after:left-0 after:right-0 after:bottom-0 after:z-99">Example Link</a>
    <time>Jan 02, 2006</time>
  </p>
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/27/300/120"
    alt="A man stands on the edge of a cliff looking out to a rough sea."
    class="w-full"
  />
</li>

##### HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li class="article-block">
    <p class="order-2">
      <a href="https://example.com">Example Link</a>
      <time>Jan 02, 2006</time>
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://example.com/source.png"
      alt="A description about this image"
    />
  </li>
</ul>

<style>
  .article-block {
    display: flex;
    position: relative;
  }

  .article-block a:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 2;
  }
</style>
```

##### Screen reader output:

And this is what NVDA will read out aloud from the above HTML only a single line!

<ul class="list-none bg-stipes-fuchsia rounded-lg font-mono m-0 p-3">
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-fuchsia-500 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none">ðŸ’¬ "Example Link" link</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-stipes-fuchsia opacity-50 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none line-through">ðŸ’¬ Image alt: "A description about this image"</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-stipes-fuchsia opacity-30 mb-3 rounded-lg list-none line-through">ðŸ’¬ Heading tag H6 0. Link "Example Link" to "https://example.com"</li>
  <li class="p-3 font-bold bg-stipes-fuchsia opacity-15 rounded-lg list-none line-through">ðŸ’¬ Jan 02, 2023</li>
</ul>
