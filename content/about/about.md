_Words kill, words give life; they’re either **poison** or fruit—you choose._

_--- Proverbs 18:21_

_Poison_ is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious** with _no external dependencies_. That's right---no JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts. No ads or trackers polluting your console window (try it out and take a look). **We kept things simple**. A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All of the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are located within the theme's _/static/_ directory. **That way you know _exactly_ what's going on your site**.

To get started, I recommend reading through my introductory post [here]({{ ref . "/posts/introducing-poison.md" }}). I use this theme on my personal site at https://lukeorth.com, so check it out if you want to see _Poison_ in action.
