## POS Store Incentive application

Breakdown of work:
- Designed and wrote application to process data from Oracle POS.
- Data is exported every day from Oracle as CSV by Saudi team and uploaded to our server.
- A Cron job on our server checks every 12 hours for a newly uploaded file.
- Application reads the CSV file, error checks, validates, formats, logs and creates files as XML (for import to ExpressionEngine), JSON (for fun) and CSV (for use in Excel).
- Data is syphoned into good and bad reports so that the Saudi team can deal with problems or system cheats (cashiers are incentivised to ask customers for data so a cashier could enter dummy data on a transaction to boost earnings).
- Using Campaign Monitor's API it then creates custom fields and subscribers. 
- Emails are sent from Campaign Monitor where successful opens can be segmented by gender, store, brand, mall, location or staff id.
